Head and neck cancers together represent the sixth most common cancer worldwide. In 2015 the incidence of this type of cancer was estimated at > 742,000 new cases (> 400,000 deaths)(Ferlay J et al., 2013). While  the most common risk factors associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) cancers are tobacco use and alcohol consumption, the past few decades reveal that a steadily increasing subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-associated HNSCC patients tend to be slightly younger, male (75%), and more often non-smokers than non-HPV HNSCCspatients; they occur most frequently in the oropharynx (Chaturvedi et al., 2013; Moore & Mehta, 2015). The incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers has increased from an estimated 40.5% before 2000 to 72.2% between 2005-2009 (Mehanna et al., 2013). In contrast to the oropharynx, only a small fraction of cancers located in the oral cavity are HPV related (Lee et al., 2012; Mehanna et al., 2016; Mirghani, Amen, Moreau, & Lacau St Guily, 2015).
